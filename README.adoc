= SpringBoot WebApp Demo

https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot]
looks like a nice way to get started.
This is a trivial webapp created using SpringBoot.

== HowTo

	mvn spring-boot:run

Or, in Eclipse with Spring plugin (or "Spring Tool Suite"), 
right-click project or Application.java, 
then RunAs->Spring Boot Application

Seconds later, connect to 

http://localhost:8000/

Note: that is port 8000, _not_ the usual 8080, to avoid conflicts.
Change this in application.properties if you don't like it.

Fill in the form and click Submit.

== War Packaging for EE App Server Deployment

This version has the modifications described in
the section entitled "Traditional Deployment"--"Create a deployable war file" in
the spring-boot reference manual (Section 85.1 as of
this writing).
it still works in Maven (`mvn package`) and can be run in Eclipse with these settings.
For WildFly users, the packaged _war_ file has a jboss-web.xml config file
so it deploys as _/springbootdemos_ when you simply copy the _war_ file to
WILDFLYHOME/standalone/deployments.
