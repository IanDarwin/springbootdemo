= SpringBoot WebApp Demo

SpringBoot looks like a nice way to get started.
This is a trivial webapp created using SpringBoot.

== HowTo

mvn spring-boot:run

then connect to http://localhost:8000/notaservlet

Note that is 8000 not the usual 8080 to avoid conflicts.
Change this in application.properties if you don't like it.

== War Deployment

It seems that you can't have both the instant-deployment convenience of Spring Boot
AND the security of a full WAR deployment in the same pom file.  You will need to 
make several changes to deploy as a WAR file. See the section entitled
"Traditional Deployment"--"Create a deployable war file" in the
spring-boot reference manual (Section 73.1 in the current snapshot as of
this writing).
